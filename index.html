            Hi there! My name is Bishwajeet Thakur. Welcome to my JavaScript Portfolio. 
            I belong from Nepal and I am currently doing my undergraduate studies here at Weber State University.
            This is my 5th semester, and it has almost been 2 years that I have been in the United States. I am very into computers and besides that, 
            I love playing cricket too. I am a really outgoing person and exploring new places interests me.
